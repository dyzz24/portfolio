                                I am a senior Frontend Developer with 6+ years of
                                experience building performant, accessible web
                                applications that scale.

                                My toolkit centers on TypeScript, React, Next.js,
                                Redux Toolkit, and GraphQL; I pair these with
                                robust testing using Jest and React Testing
                                Library.

                                I’m comfortable across styling approaches—SCSS,
                                PostCSS, CSS-in-JS—and modern build tooling like
                                Vite and Webpack.
                            </span>
                            <span>
                                I regularly use AI assistants such as GitHub
                                Copilot and ChatGPT to accelerate delivery and
                                maintain quality. Let’s talk if you need someone
                                who ships clean, reliable UI.
                            </span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
    )
}
